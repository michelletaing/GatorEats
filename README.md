# GatorEats

GatorEats is a centralized directory for all restaurants on campus, providing students and staff with an easy-to-use platform to find information about dining options, including menus, prices, wait times, and ratings. The site also includes features to help users filter through options based on dietary restrictions and nutritional information, and save their favorite places and food items. Our intent is to redesigned and optimize version of the existing UF dining website, Dine On Campus.
